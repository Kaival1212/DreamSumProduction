                                </h2>
                                <div className="text-gray-700 text-lg xl:text-xl leading-relaxed space-y-6">
                                    <p>
                                        It's an ordinary school day at the home of Junior, Lilia and Alesha in
                                        south London. Lilia, the mother, and Junior, her young son, exchange
                                        words of love before he leaves for school. Today he'll learn if he's got
                                        into the Spurs Youth Squad. Lilia is sure he has!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As Junior leaves, Lilia arranges some dead flowers. But she cuts her
                                        finger and bleeds. A foreshadowing of things to come. Alesha, her 17
                                        year-old daughter, leaves for college, but not before we see the strong
                                        bond between them.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Excited, Lilia starts preparing a celebration cake for Junior. Then like
                                        many loving mothers, she cleans his football boots.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Later, she looks at her watch - it's 6pm. She's worried. Where's Junior?
                                        He should be home. Her "sunshine" should be at home eating his
                                        celebratory cake. Suddenly, Alesha rushes in. There's been a knife fight
                                        in Croydon. Two boys have been stabbed. But who? Lilia is frozen with
                                        fear. An hour later, someone texts Alesha. One of the boys is dead, but
                                        it's not Junior. He's been taken to hospital.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, they wait, to hear which hospital he's in. Then, out of the blue, a
                                        phone call from the police. The worst news. Her Sunshine is dead. It was
                                        the other boy who survived. Lilia goes into shock, then denial, as her
                                        daughter tries to support her. She's pulled into an Arctic vortex of
                                        pain and shock and disbelief.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        At the chapel of rest, Lilia's confused. She tells her son to "Get up."
                                        In the following days, she sets up a shrine to him in her house and
                                        chats to him. She reproaches him for not doing what he was told. It's
                                        all a bit disturbing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Then suddenly, Junior is there. In front of her.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        As Alesha arrives home, an excited Lilia calls her to come and see
                                        Junior. Alesha rushes in to see an empty space. Now Lilia's brain moves
                                        on a cog: she finally accepts that her son is dead.
                                    </p>
